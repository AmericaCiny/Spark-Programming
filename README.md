# Climate Change: Project Tasmania
Installed Apache Spark on Google Colab, used the CO2 Emission and Global Temperature datasets to explore the highest average temperature among countries, top 10 countries in temperature change; Merged two datasets together and built Linear Regression Models to find the correlation between CO2emissions and temperature change.

# Venmo Text Analysis
Used Apache Spark and Python to analyze Venmo transaction data. Classified transactions using text and emoji dictionaries to determine popular emojis and categories. Created user spending behavior profiles and analyzed their evolution over 12 months. Identified friends and friends of friends for each user and calculated social network metrics such as the number of friends, clustering coefficient, and PageRank. Built regression models using MLlib to predict transaction counts based on recency, frequency, and social network metrics. 

# Car Price Prediction
Used PySpark to process the data, conducted EDA. And split the dataset into train and test datasets, then built models to predict the Out of Sample car price. Eventually, found the Random Forest model was the optimal model and plotted the feature importance.
